Production environment will have the two files:

Back-end: "VacLife-Database_be.accdb"
Front-end: "VacLife-Database_fe.accdb"

The password to access the encrypted back-end file is "vaclife" without the quotes.
The front-end file is login protected and appropriate credentials and project role will be required to access the file.

We have created a login for the Professor with System Administrator (full control) role.

Username: rudolph.brown
Pass: rb123

We have built-in security features to the production files such as disabling of navigation pane, full Access menus.

In order to see the navigation pane and see all the tables, please use the "VacLife-Database_fe - No Securities.accdb" file to bypass the security features.

A user login will still be required.
