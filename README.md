# VacLife - Bridging Gaps Between COVID Vaccine Demand and Supply

MS-Access based relational database to manage COVID vaccine appointments and inventory levels across NYC. MS-Project and Visio project management tools to design, track and deploy the system within fixed timeline.

# Project Background

In this project, an MS-Access based relational database is created to solve the logistical issues surrounding COVID-19 vaccine demand and supply by creating an all-inclusive platform that allows scheduling vaccine appointments, storingresident information, and managing vaccine inventory.

In addition to the database, the project went through full system analysis, design and deployment through a three phase approach. 

The deliverables for each phase are reported on the individual phase directories.

The front and back end for the database and the instructions to login to the database are available on the parent directory.
